- Object Detection: CV task that deals with identifying and locating objects of certain pre-defined classes within input images
- Algorithms and models such as R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLO, and SSD

------ What is Convulation? 3B1B------- 
- A mathematical operation of two functions (f and g) that produces a third function (f*g)
- Kernel : a square matrix with values
- The Kernel values can produce a different types of output for a given input
- In image Convulation the original image is multiplied by the kernel to produce another image. 
- We can produce images with borders(verticle/horizontal) or blur (gaussian,etc).

------CNN----------
- number Detection
- image is passed through multiple layers of convolution and pooling and neural networks
- pooling decreases the dimension of the image conserving only the important aspects (edges and shapes) 
- Apply an aggregation function, such as max pooling or average pooling, on each window to obtain a single values

------R(Regional)CNN-------
- CNN gained prominence for image classification tasks, however, object detection required a more intricate solution, hence RCNN.
- Starts by dividing input image into multiple regions or subregions, generating a set of potential regions in the image that are likely to contain objects.
- These regional proposals relies on external methods like Selective Search or EdgeBoxes
- Selective serach operates by merging or splitting segments of the image based on various image cues like color, texture, and shape to create a diverse set of region proposals.
- Input image -> many segmented masks -> fewer masks -> main component in the image.

--------------------------
- CNNs are Two-shot Object Detection. Less efficient and more complex
- YOLO (You only look once) and SSD(Single Shot Multibox Detector) use a single single CNN. More efficient and less complex.
